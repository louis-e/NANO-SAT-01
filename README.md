# NANO-SAT-01

IMPORTANT: This is only a model, of course it does not act like a real satellite and it won't work in space (I don't believe you will
           bring him up there anyway).
           
           
           
           
           

What can he do?
  -Charge himself with a solar panel
  -Control the satellite and his functions via wifi from the terminal
  -You can have an extern LED light up
  -You can have the onboard (D13) LED light up
  -You can force the beeper to make annoying sounds
  -You can ask the satellite what the humidity and the temperature is


What do you need to build it?
(You also can use other electronic parts but then you probably have to change something in the code)
  -Arduino Nano 33 Iot (I choosed it because it has onboard Wifi)
  -TP4056
  -Voltage Booster (from 3.7V up to 5V)
  -Lipo Battery
  -DHT11
  -LED
  -Beeper (other names are buzzer or speaker)
  -220 Ohm Resistor (for the LED)
  -100 Ohm Resistor (for the beeper
  -Solar
  -Cables
  -Diode
 
You probably also need following things
  -Soldering iron
  -A case for your electronics

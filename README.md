# NANO-SAT-01
<br>
IMPORTANT: This is only a model, of course it does not act like a real satellite and it won't work in space (I don't believe you will
           bring him up there anyway).
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What can he do?<br>
  -Charge himself with a solar panel<br>
  -Control the satellite and his functions via wifi from the terminal<br>
  -You can have an extern LED light up<br>
  -You can have the onboard (D13) LED light up<br>
  -You can force the beeper to make annoying sounds<br>
  -You can ask the satellite what the humidity and the temperature is<br>
<br>
<br>
What do you need to build it?<br>
(You also can use other electronic parts but then you probably have to change something in the code)
<br>  -Arduino Nano 33 Iot (I choosed it because it has onboard Wifi)
<br>  -TP4056
<br>  -Voltage Booster (from 3.7V up to 5V)<br>
  -Lipo Battery<br>
  -DHT11<br>
  -LED<br>
  -Beeper (other names are buzzer or speaker)<br>
  -220 Ohm Resistor (for the LED)<br>
  -100 Ohm Resistor (for the beeper<br>
  -Solar<br>
  -Cables<br>
  -Diode<br>
 <br>
You probably also need following things<br>
  -Soldering iron<br>
  -A case for your electronics<br>
